This is a peer-reviewed assignment for the coursera course "Getting and Cleaning Data".

It contains the following:
- 'README.md'

- 'CODEBOOK.md'

- 'run_analysis.R'

- 'summary.txt'

The R script downloads the data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip and creates a tidy dataset 'summary.txt'. 

For data dictionary and data tranformations, view 'CODEBOOK.md'. 

To run the R script, first install R from https://cran.r-project.org/

Once R is installed, download the R script. Open RGui and click on File -> Source R code. The R script uses relative directory paths. Hence, it can be downloaded to any folder and run.

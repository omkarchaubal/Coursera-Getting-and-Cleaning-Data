***Transformations***

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set

	The HAR dataset is downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip as a zip file. The dataset includes the following files:

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'test/subject_test.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30

	The files 'test/X_test.txt', 'test/y_test.txt' and 'test/subject_test.txt' are combined to get test dataset.
	The files 'train/X_train.txt', 'train/y_train.txt' and 'train/subject_train.txt' are combined to get train dataset.
	The train dataset and test dataset are combined to create a single dataset

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement

	The HAR dataset contains many features. The 'features.txt' is used to get the indices of the features which contain "mean()" or "std" and these indices are used to filter out only the measuresments on mean and standard deviation for each measurement from the dataset in step 1.

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

	The dataset from step 2 is merged with 'activity_labels.txt' to get the activity names. Once activity names are derived, the activity labels become redundant and is removed from the dataset.

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names

	The dataset from step 3 is merged with subset of 'features.txt' (indices of the features which contain "mean()" or "std") to get descriptive names for the feature measurements. To make the variable names more readable, "()" is removed from all variable names.

5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

	In the final step, the dataset from step 4 is aggregated by finding the mean of each variable grouped by activity and subject. The variable names are prefixed with "mean" to make it clear.
